A simple and complete Webpack 4 React Boilerplate.

* Ready to start React App :zap:
* Image loader configured :camera:
* SASS and CSS loaders configured :art:
* Hot reload configured :sunny:
* Unit test tools configured :microscope:
* Production build optimized :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## Motivation

The purpose of this boilerplate is help to create new apps and projects. It's _easy to customize_ and if you need help to understand you can check the commits for a _step-by-step_ guide.

It´s a solid base which will help to understand webpack [core concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Getting Started

To start you can simply [download](https://github.com/FerJSsilva/webpack-4-react-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) the boilerplate and unzip it into your working directory. You can also clone if you want to contribute.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v8 or above

You can check your node version using the command:

```CLI
node --version
```

### Installing

Install dependencies and start using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```CLI
yarn install
yarn start
```

Or via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```CLI
npm install
npm start
```

### Testing

You can run your tests using:

```CLI
yarn test
```

It´s possible to generate the code coverage of your code. Jest will generate a HTML file with all information from your tests. To do this run the command:

```CLI
yarn test:coverage
```

### Production build

You can generate an optimized distribution bundle. To do this run the command:

```CLI
yarn build
```

It´s possible to check the size and content of your bundled file. To do this run the command:

```CLI
yarn analyze
```

That´s it! Remember to change the project information in package.json, README and LICENSE if necessary. :mortar_board:
